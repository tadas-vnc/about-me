    <h2 class="outline smallheader">Short about me</h2>
        <p class="outline content">My name is Tadas and im 17 years old. I study at Information Technology school of Kaunas to be JavaScript programmer, even though i already know JavaScript pretty good, i still need to graduate so i can get certificate.</p>
        <h2 class="outline smallheader">Skills</h2>
        <p class="outline content">I'm very good at object orientated programming. I'm skilled with multiple programming languages including, but not limited to C#, JavaScript, Python, C++, Batch and Visual Basic Script. I did not included HTML or CSS because they do not count as programming languages. And according to Herkus JavaScript also does not count as programming language, but after doing quick google search i can prove that wrong.</p>

My least favorite subject was Lithuanian speak. In middle school my classmates knew that i was good at computer stuff, even teachers would ask me for help if there was any tech related problems.</p>
